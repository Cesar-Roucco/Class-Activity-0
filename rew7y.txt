I took an undergraduate course at VCU called Microcomputer Systems which taught many basic embedded systems concepts. As a final project in the course, we built a robot controlled by a STM32 Discovery Board. I also used embedded systems concepts in my senior design project at VCU, in which we used an ARM Cortex M4 processor to control the motors and laser inside of a Blu-ray drive. I am familiar with programming in C and C++, and also with the Keil uVision IDE.
I am interested in many aspects of computer engineering and computer science. The areas  that interest me most are probably digital logic design and computer architecture. I hope in this class to learn more advanced embedded systems concepts than what I've learned in previous courses. However, I also want to learn how to apply the concepts that I learn in interesting and innovative ways. I am excited about building the game and game controller; that sounds like a really fun project.
