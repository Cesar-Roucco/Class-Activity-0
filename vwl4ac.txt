I have taken Introduction to Embedded Computing (ECE 3430), where we used TI's
MSP430 and Code Composer Studio. I completed projects related to interrupts,
PWM, SPI, FSM, and DSP.  Outside of class, I have some experience with Arduino
and interfacing with other components using SPI and CAN communications. I have
more general programming experience with C++, Java, Python, and x86 assembly.

My main interets are embedded systems and analog circuit design. In this class,
I hope to gain practical and hands-on experience designing embedded systems from
scratch. I would also like to become more familiar with RTOS and
multi-threading.
